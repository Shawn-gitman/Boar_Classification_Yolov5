## ● What Is YOLOV5?

YOLOv5 is a family of object detection architectures and models pretrained on the COCO dataset, and represents Ultralytics open-source research into future vision AI methods, incorporating lessons learned and best practices evolved over thousands of hours of research and development(-ref. by Ultralytics).

## ● Before Starting

* This Google colaboratory doesn't support model training. Check out our latest repository of (link) for more details.

## ● What We Targert For?

* This project aims for low workforce, fast model training, and cost effective way to classify boar species. Final results are utilized for Forest and Environmental Industry to compare work performance.

## ● Research Motivation 

* Lately, ASF(African Swine Fever) conviction cases arised significantly and caused the agricultural sector an estimated billon dollars in damage.
* Human conventional methods are time expensive and caused amount of annotation mistakes.
* Contrast to previous methods, employing artificial intelligence is cost-effective, accurate, and fast in monitoring boar species.
* YOLO(You Only Look Once) has been popular for animal classification which fits well with our research.

## ● YOLO Architecture

* YOLO is composed with 24 convolutional layers and 2 fully connected layers. 
* Covolutional layers train datas based on filter, weight, and bias.
* Fully connected layers transfer 2d to 1d array in which it is used for classification results.

## ● Why YOLOv5x?

*  YOLOv5 is a leading and cutting edge technology for object detection.
*  YOLOv5x has higher MaP(Mean Average Precision) compare to YOLOv5s, YOLOv5m, and YOLOv5l. 

## ● Research Roadmap

1. Label images
2. Split image datas into 3 sets(Training - 70%, Validation - 20%, Test - 10%)
3. Start model training with training dataset
4. Evaluate the model accuaracy 
5. Use model for future classification

## ● Image Labeling

* Used LabelImg, a multi-various tool for annotating tags.

## ● Model Evaluation

* MaP(Mean Average Precision) is used for model evaluation and mearsurement.
* IOU(Intersection Over Union) is an evaluation metric used to measure accuracy of an object detector on a particular dataset.
* Recall is the number of relevant documents retrieved by a search divided by the total number of existing relevant documents.
* Precision is the number of relevant documents retrieved by a search divided by the total number of documents retrieved by that search.
* A precision-recall curve is a plot of the precision (y-axis) and the recall (x-axis) for different thresholds, much like the ROC curve.

## ● Model Optimization & Improvment Method: Hyperparameter Tuning

* Hyperparameter tuning reolves overfitting issues and increases MaP scores.
* YOLOv5 has at least 32 hyperparameters which is used for model tuning. Slight mixtures in between hyperparameters can improve the model significantly.
* Genetic Algorithm is used for searching hyperparameters effectively and increasing model accuracy.

## ● Data Sampling

* Data Sampling minimizes dataset scale that follows class ratio.
* Data sampling is used for Genetic Algorithm and it is cost and time effective way to find hyperparameters.


## ● How To Implement?

1. Save a copy of our Google colaboratory in google drive("File" - "Save a copy in drive").
2. Create file "YOLO"("/content/drive/My Drive/YOLO").
3. Upload Detect.py(Revised Detect.py), best_original.pt(Pre-trained model), and "멧돼지데이터.zip(Boar image dataset)" in file "YOLO". 
4. Start Google colaboratory by "Run All('Runtime' - 'Run All')".
