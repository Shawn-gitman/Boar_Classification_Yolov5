![Watch the video](boar_sample.jpg)
## What is YOLOV5?

YOLOv5 is a family of object detection architectures and models pretrained on the COCO dataset, and represents Ultralytics open-source research into future vision AI methods, incorporating lessons learned and best practices evolved over thousands of hours of research and development.

## How to Implement?

1. Save a copy of our google colaboratory in google drive.
2. Create file "YOLO"("/content/drive/My Drive/YOLO").
3. Upload Detect.py, best_original.pt, and "멧돼지데이터.zip" in "YOLO".
4. Start google colaboratory by "Run All(Runtime-Run All)".

## How can I download the results?
